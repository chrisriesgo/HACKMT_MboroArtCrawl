# Boro Art Crawl App

## Please read the [Wiki](https://github.com/Hacorie/MTHACK_MboroArtCrawl/wiki) in order to get started.

### Intro
This Application is being developed beginning at Hack-MT, a hack-a-thon being held on the campus of Middle Tennessee State University from January, 29 2016 through January 31, 2016.

### Purpose
The "Boro Art Crawl App" is a mobile app for both iOS and Android that is being developed in order to give the patrons of the every other month [Boro Art Crawl](http://boroartcrawl.com/) an easier way of finding their way from location to location during the event.

The committee of the "Boro Art Crawl" have said that attendees to the event have expressed that they would like a better way to know where all of the stops are. However, the snippet of the map listed on the "Boro Art Crawl's" web page is not able to capture all the points while still providing an easy to read and decipher map.

### Hack-a-thon Goals
1. Bring together individuals of varying experiences (from students to professionals) in order to learn and share knowledge by way of creative problem solving.

### Team Goals
* In order to facilitate the success of hack-a-thon goal, we are going to create a simple mobile app for Android and/or iOS that utilizes a mapping API that plots all locations for the "Boro Art Crawl" and allows the user to use built in apps (such as google maps) in order to travel to their destination.
* If time permits, add additional features that would mirror the [Boro Art Crawl](http://boroartcrawl.com/) website.

### Thinks to Keep in Mind
* Hack-a-thon's are about learning and problem solving.
* Perfection will not happen in a 36 hour time period.
* A working product that satisfies the team goals may not be accomplished, but as long as knowledge has been transferred, the hack-a-thon will be a success.
* Communication is a necessity; Do not be afraid to ask questions or express opinions about the project.
